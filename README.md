# AttendanceTrackingApp

## Brief Overview

A simple attendance tracking app with two user roles, Student and Teacher, that incorporates a login portal and a database. Students are able to log their daily attendances for all registered classes and Teachers will be able to see course attendance percentages for each individual as well as the overall attendance for each course they teach in the interactive dashboard.

## How to Run

This application is structured as a package in python, so it can either be cloned or imported by the client. Include the _"run.py"_ file, making sure that the file is in a directory with the package, and execute the command `python run.py` in your local terminal. Open the local server to see the application. A list of all users along with their login credentials is available in the _"populate_db.py"_ file within the package.
